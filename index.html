    <h1>Server Rules &amp; Guidelines</h1>

    <div class="intro">
Introduction

Please ensure you read and are familiar with all of the rules for the BHRP FivePD Server.

By joining and playing on the FivePD Server, you agree to the rules set out below.

Failure to comply with these rules will result in disciplinary action by the FivePD Staff Team.
    </div>

    <details>
      <summary>1. General Rules</summary>
      <div class="section-content">
<strong>1.1: Community Rules</strong>
The Community Rules apply to the Beehive RP FivePD Server at all times. These can be found in the BHRP Discord under #community-rules.

<strong>1.2: Maturity</strong>
All players must remain mature at all times. Your capacity to play is judged by your level of maturity, should staff deem you too immature, you may be removed from the server.

<strong>1.3: Common Sense</strong>
You must use Common Sense at all times.

<strong>1.4: Microphone</strong>
A working microphone/headset with push-to-talk settings is required to play on the server. No Microphone = No Play.

<strong>1.5: Client-side Modifications</strong>
Players using any client-side mod menus, or installed software which is not normally accessible, in order to modify the server in any capacity will be permanently banned.
Visual modifications such as MVGA &amp; NVE are approved for use.

<strong>1.6: Your Duty</strong>
If you come across things by accident, such as being able to jump high, run fast, go through walls or spawn vehicles youâ€™re not meant to, you must report this to a staff member immediately. Any players who are seen exploiting game mechanics/permissions which are in place for fair roleplay will be banned for a time determined by staff, either temporarily or permanently.

<strong>1.7: Trolling</strong>
Trolling is not permitted. This includes all forms where the intention is to interrupt roleplay. (E.g. RDM/VDM, screaming over the radio, spamming radio/voice chat with music, etc.)

<strong>1.8: Meta Gaming</strong>
Meta gaming in plain English is using or providing information that wouldn't usually be accessible to your character or another players character in a RP scene to gain an advantage. This also includes responding to calls you see aimed at a different service. Or watching someone's live stream to gain an advantage.

<strong>1.9: New Life Rule</strong>
All players must refrain from reengaging with any scene once their character is transported by St. John or Die during their roleplay. While they are allowed to continue roleplaying in other situations, this rule applies if they die again, preventing them from returning to the original scene until fully revived and cleared for participation. This restriction includes all emergency services and civilian interactions, ensuring narrative clarity and an immersive experience for everyone involved.

When given instruction by any staff member, you must follow their directions without any form of delay. Failure to do so may result in consequences.

<strong>3.2: Hostility</strong>
Being aggressive, hostile, ignorant or toxic to staff will not be tolerated at any time. If you are, this will result in consequences.

<strong>3.3: Evading Staff</strong>
Evading staff is not allowed. Do not attempt to flee, kill, drag or teleport away from staff who are trying to talk to you. They are there to help and educate you to get the most out of your time on the server. Evading staff will result in consequences.

<strong>3.4: Impersonating Staff</strong>
Impersonating staff will not be tolerated at any time. Do not pretend to be a staff member at any given time, this includes wearing any staff clothing at any given time, including the vest &amp; hoodie. If you do, this will result in consequences.

<strong>3.6: Multiple Accounts on a Single GTA or Steam Licence</strong>
If you have multiple accounts that share a copy of GTA or Steam Licence, any staff action taken on one account, will automatically affect all linked accounts.
This is not something staff can control, this is due to the licencing.
Therefore, users accept that any action will affect all linked accounts regardless of the player intended to be actioned.
Example: One account is given a 24 hour ban, every linked account will be given the same punishment. Staff can not change affected users.
You are responsible for who is using your GTA or Steam Licence. As such, we will not accept "My brother was -" or any other such excuse. If you don't want them using your account then don't allow them access.

      <summary>6. Civilian Conduct</summary>
      <div class="section-content">
<strong>6.1.1: Active QP/QVR</strong>
You're required to have an active QP and QVR so that Emergency Services are able to run your information. QP stands for 'Query Person' and QVR stands for 'Query Vehicle Registration'.  
The process of creating a QP/QVR has been streamlined as much as possible but still requires some work from civilians. Please refer to the <a href="https://nzdurriez.github.io/QP-QVR-GENERATOR/" style="orange" target="_self">QP/QVR Generator</a> under Getting Started

<strong>6.1.2: Going off duty</strong>
You're required to be Off duty if playing as a civilian, you can go Off Duty by typing <code>/offduty</code>

<strong>6.1.3: Off duty RP</strong>
There is no off duty role play. All players are either active as an emergency service or role playing as a civilian, no in between. The only exception to this rule is civilians with FRNZ pagers.

<strong>6.1.4: Interacting with Emergency Services</strong>
Civilians are no longer bound by rules to create RP scenarios. However it is encouraged they do whilst in AOP. Civs still must RP with emergency services should they interact.  
(Civilians have more opportunity to RP between each other and create semi story lines or work a day to day job (Its up to your imagination. CIV-RP suddenly is no longer a chore and a choice. Calls will still be made as it remain the baseline ethos of CIV-RP though the pressure is removed. Normal server rules still apply in the sense of cop baiting etc.)

<strong>6.1.5: Outside of AOP</strong>
Civilians are able to explore the island outside of AOP but are not to create any calls outside of AOP.  
(Normal server rules still apply, however this will allow civs who need a break or want to do their own thing to take a breather or take time to find new interesting locations to create scenarios in future.)

<strong>6.2.1: Priorities</strong>
We use a priority system to ensure the police aren't overloaded with priority jobs that require a large police response.  
The priority status is displayed on the bottom left of your screen, and will either display Inactive, Cooldown, or Priority.

When the status is either 'Cooldown' or 'Priority' and you do not currently hold the active 'Priority', you cannot do a priority job.  

<strong>Examples of a priority job are:</strong>  
Fleeing police  
(You may flee from police on cooldown or during someone else's active priority on foot (Tactics to flee must not be excessive and within reason. Exploiting certain run styles &amp; entering bodies of water which would require specialist Police resources)  
If you flee on foot and do one of the following it will be treated as a rule breach  
<ul><li>Present or use a weapon</li>
<li>Enter a vehicle and continue to flee</li>
<li>Getting back up and run after being tazed, sprayed, attacked by a dog or hit by a vehicle</li>  
<li>Attempt to flee/continue to flee from police while cuffed</li>
<li>Shooting/attacking/stabbing/harming police</li>  
<li>Events that require a large scale police response (Hostage situations, barricaded subjects, kidnapping, etc)</li></ul>If the status is 'Inactive', and you wish to do a priority, you may claim the priority status by using <code>/inp</code>.  
Once you have finished with your priority job, use <code>/cooldown</code> to end the job.

<strong>6.2.2: Placing 111 calls</strong>
Creating <code>/111</code>/<code>/105</code> calls is an important part of Civ RP. Before placing a <code>/111</code> call, check the bottom left-hand corner of your screen, and look for the 'Active Comms' display.  
If Active Comms is not active for the department you wish to create a call for, use the <code>/111</code> command. The <code>/105</code> command can also be used for non-emergency police calls.  
If the Active Comms section displays 'Call Taker', use the radio to connect to channel 4, and you will speak to a 111 call taker.

<strong>6.2.3: Restricted Civ RP</strong>
The following types of RP are restricted from being performed;  
<strong>6.2.3.1:</strong> Animal RP
