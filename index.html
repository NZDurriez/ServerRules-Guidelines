    <h1>Server Rules and Guidelines</h1>
    <div class="intro"><center>Please ensure you read and are familiar with all of the rules for the BHRP FivePD Server.
By joining and playing on the FivePD Server, you agree to the rules set out below.
Failure to comply with these rules will result in disciplinary action by the FivePD Staff Team.</center>
    </div>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>1. General Rules</strong></summary>
      <div class="content">
<strong><u>1.1: Community Rules</u></strong>

The Community Rules apply to the Beehive RP FivePD Server at all times. These can be found in the BHRP Discord under #community-rules.

<strong><u>1.2: Maturity</u></strong>

All players must remain mature at all times. Your capacity to play is judged by your level of maturity, should staff deem you too immature, you may be removed from the server.

<strong><u>1.3: Common Sense</u></strong>

You must use Common Sense at all times.

<strong><u>1.4: Microphone</u></strong>

A working microphone/headset with push-to-talk settings is required to play on the server. No Microphone = No Play.

<strong><u>1.5: Client-side Modifications</u></strong>

Players using any client-side mod menus, or installed software which is not normally accessible, in order to modify the server in any capacity will be permanently banned.
Visual modifications such as MVGA &amp; NVE are approved for use.

<strong><u>1.6: Your Duty</u></strong>

If you come across things by accident, such as being able to jump high, run fast, go through walls or spawn vehicles you’re not meant to, you must report this to a staff member immediately. Any players who are seen exploiting game mechanics/permissions which are in place for fair roleplay will be banned for a time determined by staff, either temporarily or permanently.

<strong><u>1.7: Trolling</u></strong>

Trolling is not permitted. This includes all forms where the intention is to interrupt roleplay. (E.g. RDM/VDM, screaming over the radio, spamming radio/voice chat with music, etc.)

<strong><u>1.8: Meta Gaming</u></strong>

Meta gaming in plain English is using or providing information that wouldn't usually be accessible to your character or another players character in a RP scene to gain an advantage. This also includes responding to calls you see aimed at a different service. Or watching someone's live stream to gain an advantage.

<strong><u>1.9: New Life Rule</u></strong>

All players must refrain from reengaging with any scene once their character is transported by St. John or Die during their roleplay. While they are allowed to continue roleplaying in other situations, this rule applies if they die again, preventing them from returning to the original scene until fully revived and cleared for participation. This restriction includes all emergency services and civilian interactions, ensuring narrative clarity and an immersive experience for everyone involved.

<strong><u>3.2: Hostility</u></strong>

Being aggressive, hostile, ignorant or toxic to staff will not be tolerated at any time. If you are, this will result in consequences.

<strong><u>3.3: Evading Staff</u></strong>

Evading staff is not allowed. Do not attempt to flee, kill, drag or teleport away from staff who are trying to talk to you. They are there to help and educate you to get the most out of your time on the server. Evading staff will result in consequences.

<strong><u>3.6: Multiple Accounts on a Single GTA or Steam Licence</u></strong>

If you have multiple accounts that share a copy of GTA or Steam Licence, any staff action taken on one account, will automatically affect all linked accounts.

This is not something staff can control; this is due to the licensing.

Therefore, users accept that any action will affect all linked accounts regardless of the player intended to be actioned.

Example: One account is given a 24 hour ban, every linked account will be given the same punishment. Staff can not change affected users.

You are responsible for who is using your GTA or Steam Licence. As such, we will not accept "My brother was –" or any other such excuse. If you don't want them using your account then don't allow them access.

      <summary><strong>6. Civilian Conduct</strong></summary>
      <div class="content">
<strong><u>Getting Started</u></strong>

<strong><u>6.1.1: Creating a QP/QVR</u></strong>  
QPs/QVRs are a requirement and are used by police to run your information. QP stands for 'Query Person' and QVR stands for 'Query Vehicle Registration'.  
The process of creating a QP/QVR has been streamlined as much as possible but still requires some work from civilians.

To create a QP, you must first register a character. These characters are persistent and will save across server/game restarts.  
To create a character, you must use the <code>/civ</code> command and click the 'Create Character' button at the top of the menu.  
Enter a first name followed by a last name as prompted. The menu will then ask you for a QP.

QPs are formatted specifically to provide police with the information they need. There are 2 templates below for you to use and swap out the details:

"John Smith male not known not wanted nil flags comes back to a 271 address nil actives class 1 full license 0 demerits"  
"John Smith male known and wanted for theft flags for carries weapons comes back to a 106 address nil 1 license 20 demerits"

Once you have entered your QP, your character will be created. This may take up to 2 seconds. Once your character is created, you will have to mark it as 'active'.  
You can have multiple characters active at once, but your characters will only remain active while you are in-game. Once you leave the game and re-join, you will have to use <code>/civ</code> again, select your character, and select the 'log in' button to mark it as active.

QVRs are used by police to run a vehicle's information and are a requirement for using vehicles as a civilian. QVRs will not save across restarts.  
If you are using a vehicle as a civ, you need to create a QVR for that vehicle.

To create a QVR, use <code>/civ</code>. QVRs are formatted to provide police with the information they need. Use the details below and swap out the details:

"Comes back to a green,toyota hilux utility registered to a John Smith of a 231 address license and reg both current nil flags"  
"Comes back to a green, toyota hilux utility registered to a John Smith of a 231 address license and reg both current flags stolen"

Congratulations! You've successfully setup a QP & QVR. As previously mentioned, these aren't persistent and will have to be re-created after server restarts.  
We recommend writing these down somewhere to copy/paste and save you time every time you join.

<strong><u>6.1.2: Going off duty</u></strong>  
As an emergency-based server, the default duty status is on-duty. As a civilian, you need to be off duty. This is a requirement and allows police to cuff/drag you.  
To go off duty, use <code>/offduty</code>. This is a requirement every time you join the server and wish to play as a civilian.

<strong><u>6.1.3: Off duty RP</u></strong>  
There is no off duty role play. All players are either active as an emergency service or role playing as a civilian, no in between. The only exception to this rule is civilians with FRNZ pagers.

<strong><u>6.1.4: Interacting with Emergency Services</u></strong>  
Civilians are no longer bound by rules to create RP scenarios. However it is encouraged they do whilst in AOP. Civs still must RP with emergency services should they interact.  
(Civilians have more opportunity to RP between each other and create semi story lines or work a day to day job (Its up to your imagination. CIV-RP suddenly is no longer a chore and a choice. Calls will still be made as it remain the baseline ethos of CIV-RP though the pressure is removed. Normal server rules still apply in the sense of cop baiting etc.)

<strong><u>6.1.5: Outside of AOP</u></strong>  
Civilians are able to explore the island outside of AOP but are not to create any calls outside of AOP.  
(Normal server rules still apply, however this will allow civs who need a break or want to do their own thing to take a breather or take time to find new interesting locations to create scenarios in future.)

---
<strong><u>6.2.1: Priorities</u></strong>  
We use a priority system to ensure the police aren't overloaded with priority jobs that require a large police response.  
The priority status is displayed on the bottom left of your screen, and will either display Inactive, Cooldown, or Priority.

When the status is either 'Cooldown' or 'Priority' and you do not currently hold the active 'Priority', you cannot do a priority job.  
Examples of a priority job are:  
- Fleeing police (you may flee from police on cooldown or during someone else's active priority on foot, tactics must not be excessive or exploitative)  
- Shooting/attacking/stabbing/harming police  
- Events that require a large scale police response (Hostage situations, barricaded subjects, kidnapping, etc)

If the status is 'Inactive', and you wish to do a priority, you may claim the priority status by using <code>/inp</code>.  
Once you have finished with your priority job, use <code>/cooldown</code> to end the job.

<strong><u>6.2.2: Placing 111 calls</u></strong>  
Creating 111/105 calls is an important part of Civ RP. Before placing a 111 call, check the bottom left-hand corner of your screen, and look for the 'Active Comms' display.  
If Active Comms is not active for the department you wish to create a call for, use the <code>/111</code> command. The <code>/105</code> command can also be used for non-emergency police calls.  
If the Active Comms section displays 'Call Taker', use the radio to connect to channel 4, and you will speak to a 111 call taker.

<strong><u>6.2.3: Restricted Civ RP</u></strong>  
The following types of RP are restricted from being performed:  
6.2.3.1: Animal RP  
6.2.3.2: Anything sexual in nature  
6.2.3.3: Playing a character under the age of 16  
6.2.3.4: Being on the radio channel of emergency services (1.0-3.99)  
6.2.3.5: Cop Baiting  
6.2.3.6: Discriminatory RP (religion, gender, ethnicity, politics, etc)  
6.2.3.7: Karen RP (Consistently requesting a supervisor, being extremely difficult, etc.)  
6.2.3.8: The Glock, Bushmaster, Baton Launcher, M110, Taser, Flashbang, and Radar Gun are all considered police weapons, and can't be used by civs.  
6.2.3.9: Mentally handicapped RP  
6.2.3.10: Suicide/Self Harm/Depressed RP  
6.2.3.11: Military / Military Police RP – Including overseas military/enforcement entities.

<strong><u>6.2.4: Specialized Scenes</u></strong>  
The scenes listed below require approval from an admin+ before they are conducted to ensure smooth operation. Please <code>#create-a-ticket</code> and provide an outline of your scene plan:

6.2.4.1: Any scenes involving the use of aircraft (such as helicopters or planes) for escaping from law enforcement.  
6.2.4.2: Any commercial robbery involving four (4) or more civilians (e.g., banks or stores).  
6.2.4.3: Situations where more than three (3) civilians are armed with firearms, the armed civilians must be decided upon before the prio begins. The civilians may not switch/change who has the weapons; upon death the civilians lose access to that armed member.  
6.2.4.4: Scenes set in or including Cayo Perico or the 'Chatham Islands'.  
6.2.4.5: Scenes where emergency services personnel are taken hostage.  
6.2.4.6: Scenes involving ten (10) or more civilians.  
6.2.4.7: Hitman/killing for hire RP.  
6.2.4.8: Stealing emergency vehicles.  
6.2.4.9: Acts of terror (Terrorism), Including bomb threats.  
6.2.4.10: Impersonation of Emergency Services RP.  
6.2.4.11: Escaping custody, running in cuffs or otherwise attempting to escape the custody of a police officer once they have cuffed you.  
6.2.4.12: Fake Hostages – all hostages are to fear for their life. They must not leave the building and then return to their "Captives".
